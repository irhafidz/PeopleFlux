### Installing KeplerGL from Windows 10

I learn about [KeplerGL](https://kepler.gl/) on a webinar from [DSF Lunch](https://www.datasciencefestival.com/event/dsf-lunch-learn-visualising-location-data-with-keplergl/) but got stuck with the KeplerGL installation. Read from a lot of source, turns out I need to:

What is Fiona? According to their github page:

> Fiona **reads and writes** geographic data files and thereby helps Python programmers integrate geographic information systems with other computer systems. Fiona **contains extension modules** that link the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL).

Fiona has its dependency that stated in its docs/ documentation page:

> Fiona requires `Python versions 3.6+`  
> `GDAL version 1.11â€“3.0.` 
> Fiona depends on the modules `enum34, six, cligj, munch, argparse,` and `ordereddict` (the two latter modules are standard in Python
> 2.7+). Pip will fetch these requirements for you, but users installing Fiona from a Windows installer must get them separately.
