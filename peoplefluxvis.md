### Installing KeplerGL from Windows 10

I learn about [KeplerGL](https://kepler.gl/) on a webinar from [DSF Lunch](https://www.datasciencefestival.com/event/dsf-lunch-learn-visualising-location-data-with-keplergl/) but got stuck with the KeplerGL installation. Read from a lot of source, turns out according to [this medium article](https://medium.com/@rschoudhary1999/installing-fiona-on-windows-10-for-keplergl-6af2628b6fc5) I need to:

get [Fiona](https://pypi.org/project/Fiona/) correctly.

What is Fiona? According to their github page:

> Fiona **reads and writes** geographic data files and thereby helps Python programmers integrate geographic information systems with other computer systems. Fiona **contains extension modules** that link the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL).

I decided to [re-do all what Choudary already did](https://medium.com/@rschoudhary1999/installing-fiona-on-windows-10-for-keplergl-6af2628b6fc5).

 1. Learning about Fiona reuirement & dependencies
Fiona has its dependency that stated in its docs/ documentation page:

> Fiona requires `Python versions 3.6+`  
> `GDAL version 1.11â€“3.0.` 
> Fiona depends on the modules `enum34, six, cligj, munch, argparse,` and `ordereddict` (the two latter modules are standard in Python
> 2.7+). Pip will fetch these requirements for you, but users installing Fiona from a Windows installer must get them separately.

2. Check your Python Architecture version
**3. Download the appropriate GDAL version as your Python architecture (mine is 64bit)

Go to the GDAL website release [here](http://www.gisinternals.com/release.php) and download the Windows 64 bit. I picked the MSVC2017 x64 and will be redirect [to the other page](http://www.gisinternals.com/query.html?content=filelist&file=release-1911-x64-gdal-2-4-4-mapserver-7-4-3.zip). Download GDAL version that is in appropriate with your python architecture. There are 4 download files:

 - Compiled binaries in a single .zip package (1st row)
 - Compiled libraries and headers (3rd row)
 - Installer for the GDAL python bindings (requires to install the GDAL core): my Python version is 3.7 so I pcked [GDAL-2.4.4.win-amd64-py3.7.msi](http://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1911-x64-gdal-2-4-4-mapserver-7-4-3/GDAL-2.4.4.win-amd64-py3.7.msi) (3rd last from below)
 - Installer for the GDAL ECW 3.3 plugin (must be installed to the same directory as the GDAL core, the 3.3 and 5.x versions cannot be installed side by side) (last row)

How to check Python Architecture version
   

     import platform as p
        print(p.architecture())
        ('64bit', 'WindowsPE')

Do the installation
**3. Installation**

Install GDAL core and then GDAL python binding from msi installers.
